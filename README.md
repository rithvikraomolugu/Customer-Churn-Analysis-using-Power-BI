### Key Insights

1. **Tenure is the strongest churn driver**  
   Customers in the 0–1 year tenure group show the highest churn rate. Churn consistently decreases as customer tenure increases.

2. **Gender has minimal impact on churn**  
   Male and female customers have nearly identical churn rates, indicating gender is not a major influencing factor.

3. **Senior citizens churn more frequently**  
   Although senior citizens form a smaller customer segment, they exhibit a noticeably higher churn tendency.

4. **Fiber optic internet users have higher churn**  
   Customers using fiber optic internet show significantly higher churn compared to DSL and non-internet customers.

5. **Lack of online security increases churn risk**  
   Customers without online security services are more likely to churn, highlighting the importance of add-on services.

6. **Contract type strongly affects retention**  
   Month-to-month contract customers have the highest churn rate, while one-year and two-year contracts show better retention.

7. **Billing method influences churn behavior**  
   Customers using electronic check payments experience higher churn compared to other payment methods.

8. **New customers are the highest-risk segment**  
   Early-stage customers combined with flexible contracts represent the most vulnerable churn group.
